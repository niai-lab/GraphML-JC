    <h2>Overview</h2>
  </p>

  <h4><b>Mission Statement</b></h4>
  <p>This journal club aims to provide a forum for graph-ML, deep generative models and computational neuroscience with diverse machine learning and neuroscience backgrounds. Weekly meetings will focus on a paper relevant to a theoretical understanding of some
    graph neural network problem or system. Graduate students and postdocs are especially encouraged to attend and propose/present papers. Appropriate papers present neural data, theoretical models, foundational principles for computation, new
    statistical, mathematical, or machine learning methods, etc.</p>
