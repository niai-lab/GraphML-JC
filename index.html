  <h4><b>Mission Statement</b></h4>
  <p>We read and discuss the latest papers in machine learning and computational neuroscience.
    The hope is to generate new ideas and keep up-to-date with the literature.<br /><br />
    
    Weekly meetings will focus on three themes: graph-based machine learning, deep generative models, and ML4Neuroscience.<br>
    All meetings will be in person or on <a href="https://zoom.us/j/92336352299?pwd=b0JwWnByTDRIamhpcktYdGx0aGxkZz09">Zoom</a>. Graduate students and postdocs are especially encouraged to attend and propose/present papers.
    Appropriate papers present foundational principles for computation, new statistical, mathematical, or machine learning methods, etc.
